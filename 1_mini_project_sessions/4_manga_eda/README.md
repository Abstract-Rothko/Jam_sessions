# Manga Dataset EDA:
## Background
I wanted to analyze, clean and then visualize a dataset for the first time! To make things easy for myself, I decided to do a small dataset so that any problems along the way would be more manageable.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Phone
- Notebook

## Data Visuals
### Demographics of Best-selling Manga
![demographic plot](assets/Demographic_chart.png)
This plot shows the total counts for each demographic in the dataset. it is `not-at-all-surprising` which demographic is the highest.

### Publication Status of Best-selling Manga
![publication status plot](assets/publication_status_chart.png)
This plot shows the publication status for each manga. The next time I would rather use a pie plot than a bar plot for this and use percentages. 
What astonished me is how many successful manga go on `hiatus`. If there was more data I'd investigate this trend further.

### Best Selling Manga Publishers
![publisher plot](assets/Publisher_chart.png)
This plot shows to which publisher each of the manga belongs. For the dataset, I had simplify alot, otherwise this particular plot would not have displayed so cleanly. 

I am happy with how it looks, but I am also not surprised to see who is in the lead.

## What I learnt:

- **Data Cleaning**: Going forward, I need to pay more attention on how to effectively clean a dataset for better analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Deciding which types of plots to use, what colours work best and how to set up the data for an effective visual is a fun process to learn about.
- **EDA**: Exploratory Data Analysis helps you ask better questions about the dataset. What insights am I trying to get from this dataset? What stands out?

## Conclusion
I think I did good, so for the next one I set an intention to learn more, explore better and draw more useful insights from my analysis.
