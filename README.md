# “Jam Sessions”

Hello and welcome to my project~!

Well, I say that, but the entire purpose behind this `jam sessions` repository is that it becomes a basket for any and all things I do that help develop my programming skills(specifically __python__). 

This will be where all my practice gets shown off, essentially.

__All of my sessions will be posted into 3 categories:__

1. **mini_project_sessions**: this will a collection of small projects to test what I've been learning.

2. **practice_sessions**: a collection of notes and other miscellaneous things.

3. **junk_sessions**: as stated, it's a collection of junk. Don't worry about it.

If you're curious, I'll do my best to regarly update this readme file with my progress. All feedback is welcome.

## Mini-Projects:

1. [logplan_module](1_mini_project_sessions/1_logplan_module) - this is a module with 25 functions that could be used in the logistics planning department(especially packaging).

2. [one_piece_quiz](1_mini_project_sessions/2_one_piece_quiz) - this quiz tests you on a few basic questions on one piece and scores how well you've done.

3. _In Progress_

## Practice/Study Notes:

1. _In Progress_


## Junk Ideas:

1. __As previously stated, it will be a collection of junk. Don't worry about it.__
